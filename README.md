# COSC 404 - Database System Implementation<br>Lab 4 - Query Processing with Iterators

This lab practices programming with iterators.

## Programming Iterators (30 marks)

You will implement three relational algebra operators as iterators.  You are not required to edit most of the provided code files. **Note that there is a `FileManager.java` for opening and closing files, and `Tuple.java` has methods for reading and writing tuples from files.  Make use of these files!** Here are the three operators you have to implement:

- In `TextFileScan.java` complete `init()`, `next()`, and `close()` methods to create an operator called `TextFileScan` to scan a text file as a set of tuples. (Test file: `TestScan.java`) *(5 marks)*

- In `NestedLoopJoin.java` write the code to implement a tuple nested-loop join.  The general form of the iterator is in the query processing notes. (Test file: `TestNestedLoopJoin.java`) *(10 marks)*

- In `MergeJoin.java`, implement the merge portion of a sort join (assume the inputs are already sorted).  You will have to design this iterator totally yourself.  Note that it is easiest to initially assume that there cannot exist duplicate keys in either input (e.g. two 1's in left input), but eventually you will need to have a strategy to buffer input from the left side if there are multiple tuples with the same key on the right side in order to complete all the joins. (Test file: `TestMergeJoin.java`) *(15
marks)*

- EXTRA CREDIT: Create from scratch the class `BlockNestedLoopJoin.java` to implement the block nested-loop join operator as an iterator. (Test file: `TestNestedBlockJoin.java`) *(Extra credit up to 10 marks)*

## Submission

The lab can be marked immediately by the professor or TA by showing the output of the JUnit tests and by a quick code review.  Otherwise, submit the URL of your GitHub repository on Canvas. **Make sure to commit and push your updates to GitHub.**
